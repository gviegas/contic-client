# Contic Client

Client application that uses data stored on the [Contic Server](https://github.com/gviegas/contic-server). 

This application was made with:

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/)
* [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) was used for development. It can be installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
npm install -g create-react-app
```
Once npm is installed, use it to run the application (in development mode):

```sh
npm start
```
